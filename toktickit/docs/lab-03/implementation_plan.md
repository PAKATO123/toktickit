## Detailed Feature Specifications

### F-01 · Database Schema Evolution & Data Migration
**Prerequisites:** Lab 2 baseline  
**Branch:** `feature/lab03-01-schema-and-migration`  
**Status:** ✅ Merged

Expand the PostgreSQL Prisma schema and seed script to support real users, authentication, roles, ticket ownership, comments, notes, and status workflow.

**Scope:**
- Update `server/prisma/schema.prisma`:
  - `Role` Enum: `REQUESTER`, `IT_STAFF`, `ADMINISTRATOR`
  - `User` model: `id`, `email` (unique), `passwordHash`, `name`, `role`, `isActive`, `mustChangePassword`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
  - `Ticket` model additions: `assignedToId` (User relation), `itPriority` (enum string), `isRequesterResolved` (boolean), timestamps
  - `PublicComment` model: `id`, `ticketId`, `authorId`, `content`, `createdAt`
  - `InternalNote` model: `id`, `ticketId`, `authorId`, `content`, `createdAt`
- Data Migration Script:
  - Migrate Lab 2 `Requester` rows into `User` records (`role = REQUESTER`, `passwordHash` hashed `Password123!`, `mustChangePassword = true`).
  - Link `Ticket.requesterId` directly to `User.id`.
- Idempotent Seed Script (`prisma/seed.ts`):
  - 4 active + 1 inactive Requesters (`requester1@toktickit.local` ... `requester5@toktickit.local`)
  - 3 active + 1 inactive IT Staff (`staff1@toktickit.local` ... `staff4@toktickit.local`)
  - 1 active Administrator (`admin@toktickit.local`)
  - 10+ realistic Tickets distributed across statuses (`New`, `Open`, `In Progress`, `Waiting for Requester`, `Pending Verification`, `Resolved`, `Closed`), priorities, and assignments
  - Sample Public Comments and confidential Internal Notes

**Testable when F-01 is done:**
- `npx prisma migrate dev` executes without errors.
- `npm run prisma:seed` runs twice without errors or duplicate records.
- Database inspection confirms migrated `User` rows, `Ticket.assignedToId`, `PublicComment`, and `InternalNote` structures.

### F-02 · Authentication Backend & Auth Middleware
**Prerequisites:** F-01  
**Branch:** `feature/lab03-02-auth-backend`  
**Status:** ✅ Merged

Implement backend session management, credential validation, password hashing, and authentication API endpoints.

**Scope:**
- Password Hashing: `bcryptjs` with salt rounds >= 10.
- Auth Middleware & Guards:
  - Session tracking using HttpOnly cookies (`express-session`).
  - `requireAuth`: Verifies active session, checks `isActive = true`.
  - `requireRole(...roles)`: Enforces role-based route authorization.
  - `requireFirstLoginCompleted`: Redirects/blocks users with `mustChangePassword = true`.
- Authentication Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Validates active user credentials, establishes session, returns user identity and role.
  - `POST /api/auth/logout`: Destroys session and clears cookie.
  - `GET /api/auth/me`: Returns current authenticated user context.
  - `POST /api/auth/change-password`: Validates password complexity (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit), updates hash, sets `mustChangePassword = false`.
- API Integration Tests (`server/tests/lab-03/auth.api.test.ts`):
  - Happy path login, logout, profile fetch, password change.
  - Invalid password (401), inactive account (401), weak new password (400).

**Testable when F-03 is done:**
- `POST /api/auth/login` returns `200 OK` with session cookie for valid credentials.
- Deactivated user login returns `401 Unauthorized`.
- User with `mustChangePassword = true` attempting restricted endpoints receives forced password change error.
- All auth unit and API tests in `auth.api.test.ts` pass.

### F-03 · Server-Side Authorization & Requester Refactoring
**Prerequisites:** F-02  
**Branch:** `feature/lab03-03-authorization-and-requester-refactor`  
**Status:** ✅ Merged

Refactor Lab 2 Requester endpoints to use session identity and enforce server-side data isolation.

**Scope:**
- Remove reliance on client-supplied `requesterId` parameters; bind all Requester queries to `req.user.id`.
- Scoping guards:
  - `GET /api/tickets`: Returns only tickets where `requesterId === req.user.id`.
  - `POST /api/tickets`: Sets `requesterId = req.user.id` automatically.
  - `GET /api/tickets/:id` & attachments: Rejects cross-requester access with `403 Forbidden`.
- Requester Resolution Request Endpoint (`PATCH /api/tickets/:id/resolve-indication`):
  - Requesters can request problem resolution on their owned ticket.
  - Sets `isRequesterResolved = true` and updates status to `Pending Verification`.
- API Integration Tests (`server/tests/lab-03/authorization.api.test.ts`):
  - Requester isolation verification.
  - Cross-user ticket access rejection (`403 Forbidden`).

**Testable when F-03 is done:**
- Requesters can only access their own tickets and attachments.
- Passing another user's `requesterId` in request bodies is ignored.
- Requester resolution request updates ticket status to `Pending Verification`.
- `authorization.api.test.ts` passes.

### F-04 · IT Staff Ticket Queue & Workflow Backend
**Prerequisites:** F-02, F-03  
**Branch:** `feature/lab03-04-staff-queue-and-workflow-backend`  
**Status:** ✅ Merged

Implement the shared IT Staff Ticket Queue API, ticket ownership management, priority management, status state machine workflow, and comments/notes APIs.

**Scope:**
- Queue Retrieval (`GET /api/tickets/staff-queue`):
  - Accessible to `IT_STAFF` and `ADMINISTRATOR` roles only (`403` for Requesters).
  - Search: Substring keyword match on `ticketNumber`, `summary`, `description`.
  - Filters: `status`, `itPriority`, `assignment` (`unassigned`, `me`, `assignedToId`).
  - Sorting: `createdAt`, `itPriority`, `currentStatus` (`asc` / `desc`).
  - Pagination: `page`, `pageSize` (10, 25, 50).
- Ownership Endpoints:
  - `PATCH /api/tickets/:id/claim`: Sets `assignedToId = req.user.id`.
  - `PATCH /api/tickets/:id/assign`: Reassigns `assignedToId` to specified IT Staff user.
- Priority Endpoint (`PATCH /api/tickets/:id/priority`):
  - Updates `itPriority` (`Urgent`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`).
- Status Workflow Endpoint (`PATCH /api/tickets/:id/status`):
  - Validates status transitions per state machine matrix:
    - `New` ➔ `Open`, `In Progress`, `Cancelled`
    - `Open` / `In Progress` / `Waiting for Requester` ➔ `Pending Verification` (Requester) or `Resolved` / `Closed` / `Cancelled` (Staff)
    - `Pending Verification` ➔ `Resolved` / `Closed` (Staff confirm) OR `In Progress` / `Open` (Staff revert if unsolved, resetting `isRequesterResolved = false`)
    - `Resolved` ➔ `Closed`, `Reopened`
    - `Closed` ➔ `Reopened`
- Public Comments & Confidential Internal Notes APIs:
  - `GET / POST /api/tickets/:id/comments`: Public comments for ticket owner, staff, admin.
  - `GET / POST /api/tickets/:id/notes`: Confidential notes for staff and admin only (`403` for Requesters).
- API Integration Tests (`staff-queue.api.test.ts`, `staff-ticket-detail.api.test.ts`, `comments-notes.api.test.ts`).

**Testable when F-04 is done:**
- `GET /api/tickets/staff-queue` returns paginated system tickets for Staff/Admin, returns `403` for Requester.
- Ticket claiming and reassignment update `assignedToId`.
- Invalid status transition (e.g. `New` ➔ `Closed`) returns `400 Bad Request`.
- Staff revert resets status to `In Progress` and clears `isRequesterResolved`.
- All backend integration tests pass.
